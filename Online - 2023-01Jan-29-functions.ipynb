    "# How do I define a function?\n",
    "\n",
    "Defining a function means: Teaching Python a new verb.  We do this in terms of other verbs that were already defined.\n",
    "\n",
    "We do this with the `def` keyword. The syntax looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def NAME():\n",
    "    BODY_LINE_1\n",
    "    BODY_LINE_2\n",
    "    BODY_LINE_3\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The name of a function can be any legal \"identifier\" name in Python -- any number of letters, numbers, and `_` characters, but the name cannot start with a number, and shouldn't start with an `_`.\n",
    "\n",
    "You must have parentheses after the function name; we'll fill those in later, but for now, they'll be blank.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then we have a colon, followed by any number of indented lines.\n",
    "\n",
    "The indented lines are the \"body\" of the function.  They can have any number of characters, we can have any number of lines, and the function body can contain just about any Python code you want -- including `if`, `for`, `open`, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "When I define a function, I'm teaching Python a new verb. But I'm not actually *executing* or *running* the function just yet. I'm just defining it."

    "# Functions are nouns, not just verbs\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the biggest things to understand in Python is that functions are nouns (data), not just verbs.\n",
    "\n",
    "They are assigned to variables, just like other data can be.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we say\n",
    "\n",
    "    x = 5\n",
    "    \n",
    "we're assigning the integer 5 to the variable `x`. And when we use `def` to define a function, we're assigning a \"function object\" to the variable `hello`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Who cares? Why do we need to think about function objects?\n",
    "\n",
    "A few reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. If you use a variable name for a function, then you cannot use it for data, and vice versa.\n",
    "2. The rules for variable scoping (which we'll talk about later) are exactly the same for function scoping.\n",
    "3. We can pass functions around, as if they were data.\n",
    "4. *MOST IMPORTANT* when we define a function, we're defining the blueprint for what we want to happen when we execute it. The actual execution takes that blueprint, and then runs the code in a separate place. Every time we run a function, that happens inside of a special place in memory."
