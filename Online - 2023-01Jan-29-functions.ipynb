    "\n",
    "Defining a function means: Teaching Python a new verb.  We do this in terms of other verbs that were already defined.\n",
    "\n",
    "We do this with the `def` keyword. The syntax looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def NAME():\n",
    "    BODY_LINE_1\n",
    "    BODY_LINE_2\n",
    "    BODY_LINE_3\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The name of a function can be any legal \"identifier\" name in Python -- any number of letters, numbers, and `_` characters, but the name cannot start with a number, and shouldn't start with an `_`.\n",
    "\n",
    "You must have parentheses after the function name; we'll fill those in later, but for now, they'll be blank.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then we have a colon, followed by any number of indented lines.\n",
    "\n",
    "The indented lines are the \"body\" of the function.  They can have any number of characters, we can have any number of lines, and the function body can contain just about any Python code you want -- including `if`, `for`, `open`, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "When I define a function, I'm teaching Python a new verb. But I'm not actually *executing* or *running* the function just yet. I'm just defining it."
